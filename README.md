# JavaScript TODO Tracker

#### This app is a single, (almost) self-modifying file!

A TODO list tracker written in JavaScript, this is an offline, no-frills solution to TODO tracking.  The entire web-page may be saved, so that a list can be tracked daily, especially if paired with a revision management system, such as GIT.

The file is not *exactly* self modifying, you must download and save the new file when you are done working.

There is no styling or external resources which need to be loaded.  This *JavaScript* program works **offline**, which is the primary goal of this TODO tracker.
